Two months ago, my educational coach asked, "Are you interested in joining the beta program? You'll have access to a technical coach once a week, study groups, and be able to pair program with other students in the cohort." Hold my poodle. Additional resources at my fingertips at no extra cost? I'm in! 

I looked through the syllabus for Week 1 and noticed that I was already behind. Did I feel a bit anxious? Sure, especially since my personal (and realistic) goal was to complete one to two labs per day. In an effort to keep up with the curriculum, I sacrificed sleep, arranged times to pair program with my technical coach during lunch breaks, and practiced saying "no." I was determined to catch up and not fall more than a week behind. Since I am out of the house 12+ hours of the day, I learned to strategically map out where I would be able to access WiFi. Thanks to Spectrum, I was able to sign-in while sitting in my car. It may not have been the most reliable internet connection, but it was something. 

One of the requirements for the beta program was pair programming with a classmate once a week. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the term, pair programming consists of two people who write code together, one being the "driver" (writes the code) and the other the "navigator" (observes and reviews the code). After each week of coding with a new student, I became less anxious about where I was in the curriculum. Several students shared that they took a short break at some point (Life happens...it's inevitable.) and are determined to complete the program. Others mentioned that they have struggled with the same concepts and shared several online resources with me. 

I'm glad that I had the opportunity to get to know some of my classmates, hear their stories, and practice speaking "tech." It wasn't until I started pair programming that I truly felt like I wasn't alone. We laughed, we vented, we struggled...but in the end, we'd always *Git-It-Done*.
