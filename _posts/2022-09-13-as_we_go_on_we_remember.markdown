As I sit here just minutes after submitting my final project and scheduling an assessment for next week, I remember the feelings I had on Day 1 of my #codenewbie journey--a mixed bag of excitement, curiosity, and dry, red eyes at 5 am (ya'll know what I'm talking about). As a self-paced student working full-time and juggling all sorts of responsibilities that come with life, I feel proud of what I've created and accomplished over the last few years. Transitioning careers is challenging as heck, especially during these uncertain times, but it's possible.

I came across that quote last week as I scoured the internet for tutorials on the latest versions of React and react-router-dom because of errors in the console. Technology will continue to evolve and change. When I first started coding, I felt like I had to memorize and remember everything. Now I have various bookmarks in my browser and some physical reference materials. Knowing where to look and which questions to ask is a skill in itself. 

In the midst of compilation errors, extra semi-colons, a lonely curly bracket, and syntax errors, take a moment for yourself and identify a few "wins." Whether you just wrote your first "Hello World" or landed an interview this week...congrats! I'm cheering you on.
