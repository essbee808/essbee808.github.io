It's officially been a month since I started Flatiron's Online Full Stack Web Developer program.  As I sit here and reflect back on the past few weeks, I think about some of the challenges that I've faced and some strategies that have helped me to stay on track thus far. 

## **1. Time Management**

Juggling full-time employment, commuting in between clients six days a week, embracing the company of my fellow *Angelenos* on the 405 and 10 freeways, writing reports, and having to rearrange my schedule due to IPP meetings for clients has been a doozy. In my mind, I thought that I could do it all and multi-task throughout the day. I soon realized that:

**a) Set boundaries.**

*"I can't meet at our scheduled time, but I'm available after 8 PM."*
Before going back to school, it was easy for me to be the "yes" girl at work. Nowadays, I need to remind myself that it's       okay to say no sometimes. If I receive a non-urgent text/phone call from a client, a response can wait until I'm done               working on a lesson/lab or when I see them next. 



**b) Turn off my phone.**

Having a phone can both be useful and distracting. I don't do this often, just in case a crisis arises or family needs to           get in touch with me, but when I do, the feeling is absolutely amazing. I become more focused on the lesson and am less likely to respond to a work-related call/email with my itchy fingers.



**c) Quizlet is awesome.**

Having to be mobile throughout the day and not knowing what sorts of resources will be available in the area (i.e.       empty chair at a coffee shop, stable Wi-Fi, outlets, parking, etc.) can be challenging. However, I still found a way to be productive by creating flashcards on Quizlet. If I have some down time during the day, even if it is 12 minutes, I cycle through my flashcards and review concepts from previous lessons.



## **2. Self-Care**


In the midst of maintaining a household, working, and going to school, it's easy to forget the importance and value of self-care. A few weeks ago, I woke up and noticed that my eyes were red. There were no other symptoms, only that it was noticeable. Later, I found out that it was stress-related. I stepped back and realized that I needed to make some changes in order to maintain a healthier balance in my life. 


**a) Go to sleep at a reasonable hour.**

I made it a goal to be in bed between 10:30 PM to 11:00 PM. As a result, I've noticed improvements in memory and feel rejuvenated the next morning.



**b) Play music.**

My home office doubles up as a work space and a music room. During my breaks, I pick up an instrument and start playing. Sometimes, I even take it a a step further...

**c) Exercise a few times a week.**

For me, this can look like an intense game of fetch with my dog, a walk to the grocery store, or playing VR games like Soundboxing and Superhot.
