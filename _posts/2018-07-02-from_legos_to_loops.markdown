*"How was work today?*"

*"It was great! I surpassed my 10,000 steps goal, went to my first Pokemon Go raid, rode the 8 bus to Guitar Center, and made $12.77 on Job Spotter."*

Once upon a time (six years ago, to be exact), I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Psychology. I thought that I had it all figured out: take a year off from school, find work experience out in the " real world," then apply for a master's program. That was the plan. What I realized was that there were only two things that I knew about myself: 1) I want to work with people and 2) I want to do something that matters. One year eventually turned into two...then three...then four...well, you get the picture. During this "discovery phase" of my life, I've worn a number of hats, including Behavioral Therapist, Vocal/Music Instructor, and Direct Support for adults diagnosed with developmental and intellectual disabilities. I've had the opportunity to cross paths with many individuals in related fields, sparking my interest in related fields such as occupational therapy, speech-language pathology, and social work. 

As a Behavioral Therapist, I I learned to tailor my approach based on my client's interests and needs. Upon completing my post-baccalaureate program in Communication Disorders, I found myself devoting more time into googling best apps for non-verbal children, visual timers/schedules, and a DIY token economy instead of "Assessment of Articulation and Phonological Disorders." I was more interested in finding alternative solutions for my clients to communicate their immediate needs (i.e. Picture Exchange Communication System) rather than conducting assessments. Within the past year, my google search history shifted from "apps for children with Autism" to "top dating apps or websites for people with disabilities." To this day, I still enjoy the creative process and the never-ending puzzle that exists at the end of my work day.

After being out in the field and seeing how much technology is integrated in each client's daily routine, I became more curious about all things tech. I spent several months utilizing free resources, watching YouTube videos, listening to podcasts, and researching bootcamp programs that would be the best fit for me and my learning style. Flatiron School checked every box on my list. Now that I am a Flatiron student, I hope to continue to make an impact on my clients' lives by making websites and mobile applications more user friendly, providing visuals to help reduce some of the anxiety that is associated with public transportation, identifying other ways to promote socialization, and finding ways to encourage daily exercise. As a part of the Flatiron community, I am excited for the opportunity to create things that matter.
