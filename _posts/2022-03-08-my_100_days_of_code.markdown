> "All big things come from small beginnings. The seed of every habit is a single, tiny decision." - James Clear

I know that I'm not alone in this when I say that the the last few years had its challenges on so many fronts. From the mental and emotional impact of the pandemic to compassion fatigue at work, to Kobe Bryant and Betty White, various devastating natural distasters...it was (is?) a strange time. As a self-paced student, it grew increasingly difficult for me to process new information and stay motivated. However, with the support of my colleagues and a number of resources, I completed the 100 Days of Code Challenge and as a result, finished my rails portfolio project. 

#### **C** *reate*
Routines and/or rituals helped me to establish and implement boundaries more effectively, especially on days when I was able to WFH. One thing I did was create separate environments, depending on which tasks were involved (i.e. work-related, coding, leisure, etc.). As a matter of fact, at the time of writing this post, I am sitting at a foldable desk facing a white wall with the door closed haha. Doing so helped me to better transition to tasks accordingly and ultimately achieving that "flow" state of mind.

Additionally, I created short routines and rituals for myself. I was never a morning person--at all. I was the i-won't-know-what-time-it-is-until-i-look-up-from-my-computer-and-see-sunlight person. What I soon experienced were the effects of lack of sleep. Although it was not immediate, I acclimated to a new morning routine: wake up at 5 am, play Wordle and Sudoku, make coffee, feed the pets, and code before work.

**"If it's free, it's for me!"**
[Libby](https://libbyapp.com/interview/welcome#doYouHaveACard
) gives me access to free ebooks and audiobooks with a valid library card. (If you don't have a library card, you can get one online). I listened to "Atomic Habits" by James Clear during my morning routine and selected one strategy to incorporate throughout the day.


#### **U** *pdate *
As part of the criteria for the 100 Days of Code Challenge, I updated others by sharing my progress on social media. One of the women I follow on Instagram released a 100 Days of Code Journal. It helped me track my daily progress and key milestones, also keeping it separate from my daily planner. 


#### **D** *elete*
After creating and optimizing my coding environment, I took it a step futher by deleting distractions (or at least making them seem less appealing and less accessible in the moment). I don't know about you, but I can't remember passwords to save my life. Fortunately, this worked in my favor as I signed out of streaming apps after each session and preferred not to get locked out of my account again.
