For my CLI Project, I wanted to create something that was applicable to the population that I currently work with. Since many of them are looking for employment, I decided to extract data from Indeed.com, display a list of jobs based on the zipcode entered, and also provide details. Often times, my clients become overwhelmed when presented with lots of information at once. In hopes of making it easier to "chunk" and process information visually, I utilized extra spaces and the colorize gem to make the distinction between attributes, values, prompts/questions, and the user's input.

The feedback that I received during the process helped to extend the functionality of my CLI application. For example, one user mistyped her zipcode and asked if she could go back and type a different zipcode. I remember feeling excited as I showed her the changes that I made to a conditional statement in my #make_selection method.
