For my CLI project, I wanted to create something that was applicable to the population that I currently work with. Since many of them are looking for employment, I decided to extract data from Indeed.com, display a list of jobs based on the zipcode entered, and also provide details. Often times, my clients become overwhelmed when presented with lots of information at once. In hopes of making it easier to "chunk" and process information visually, I utilized extra spaces and the colorize gem to make the distinction between attributes, values, prompts/questions, and the user's input.

This project tested my knowledge of object-oriented programming and provided opportunities for me to become more familiar with git commands. The feedback that I received during the process also helped to extend the functionality of my CLI application. For example, one user mistyped her zipcode and asked if she could go back and type a different zipcode. I wrote out pseudo code, used pry to check return values and made changes to the conditional statement in my #make_selection method.

What was most difficult for me was having to look at a blank page in my text editor. Before starting this project, I was able to run tests, type 'pry', and edit code. Even after being given general instructions and understanding what needed to be included in the application, it was still challenging for me to create something from scratch. After developing the framework and writing pseudo-code, I became more confident in my coding abilities.
